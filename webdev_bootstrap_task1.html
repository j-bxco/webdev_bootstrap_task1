                        Sofia, on the other hand, is a Greek name that means "wisdom." Hence, the meaning of my name is youthful wisdom.</p>

                        Sometimes, these challenges can't be solved within the day. It is important to remember that newfound strength and thoughts are made for every day that passes. This can help us deal with the problems we can't solve or deal with for the day.</p>

                    <p>As someone who loves creating things and playing games, being a game developer is a job that caught my attention.<br>
                        It combines creativity and logic, which I enjoy. Though I am aware of how difficult it is to be a game developer, I feel that it is gratifying once you see the final product of your rigorous coding and brainstorming.</p>
